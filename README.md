# Black Box Challenge API

This project mimics a set of mysterious API endpoints for a reverse engineering challenge. Your goal is to deduce the behavior of each endpoint by experimenting with inputs and analyzing outputs.

## Endpoints
- `POST /data`
- `GET /time`
- `POST /fizzbuzz`
- `POST /zap`
- `POST /alpha`
- `POST /glitch`

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Run the test script (in another terminal):
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Testing
Test scripts are in the `test/` folder. You can also use Postman or curl to experiment with the endpoints.

## Goal
Reverse engineer and document the behavior of each endpoint. Update this README with your findings.
